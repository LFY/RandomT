RandomT: declarative probabilistic programming
==============================================

Installation

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Usage
=====

Examples in examples/ directory. Start with basic.py.

1. Import language environment

from RandomT import *

2. Construct random variable

X = Flip() # Is some random integer

3. Combine with other random variables using base class methods

Y = X + X

4. Run probability queries

# Pr(query, evidence, implementation)

print Pr(Y, {}, VarElim)
{0 : 0.5, 2 : 0.5}

How to make a RandomT random variable
=====================================

2 ways.

1. Create a 0-arg function (thunk) that performs a draw from the distribution using Random(T) where T is the base type (Will take out this type annotation requirement in a later build).

from random import randint

X = Random(int)(lambda : randint(0, 5))

2. Create a Dist, which holds a dictionary describing the full probability distribution.

X = Random(int)(Dist({0 : 0.2, 1: 0.2, 2: 0.2, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.2}))

Currently supported inference implementations
===================================

RejectionSampler
VarElim
BNT (requires matlab and BNT installation)
