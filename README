RandomT: declarative probabilistic programming
==============================================

Installation

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

Usage
=====

Examples in examples/ directory. Start with basic.py.

1. Import language environment

from RandomT import *

2. Construct random variable

X = Flip() # Is some random integer

3. Combine with other random variables using base class methods

Y = X + X

4. Run probability queries

# Pr(query, evidence, implementation)

print Pr(Y, {}, VarElim)
{0 : 0.5, 2 : 0.5}

How to make a RandomT random variable
=====================================

2 ways.

1. Create a 0-arg function (thunk) that performs a draw from the distribution. The function must return values of a consistent type, or the operations on this random variable will not be well defined.

from random import randint

X = RndVar(lambda : randint(0, 5))

2. Create a Dist, which holds a dictionary describing the full probability distribution. The keys must all be of the same type and must be hashable objects, otherwise the operations on this random variable are not well defined/sampled values cannot be meaningfully compared for equality.

X = RndVar(Dist({0 : 0.2, 1: 0.2, 2: 0.2, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.2}))

Currently supported inference implementations
===================================

RejectionSampler
VarElim
BNT (requires matlab and BNT installation)
